# Breaking changes

- The expiration time in the channel key is now using Unix timestamp instead of .NET ticks. This requires previously generated keys with an expiration to be regenerated.
- New channel parser now more strict and enforces the trailing slash '/' (e.g.: "a/b/c/" will parse and "a/b/c" won't parse)
- Configuration for TCP/TLS now accepts golang address format, (eg.: ":8080" would listen to all addresses and port 8080)
- Cluster configuration has now more options and 'port' was renamed to gossip.
- Cluster messaging now requires 2 ports to be open, one for gossip (TCP & UDP) and one for the actual message routing (TCP)
